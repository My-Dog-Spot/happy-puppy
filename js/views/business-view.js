/**
 * Key concepts: IIFE, Module Pattern, Anonymous Closing Function.
 * The var app thing and the IIFE that follows it is all a part of implementing the module pattern.
 * Decomposed functionality into self contained meaningful js files. But you can't say which runs
 * first, so that's what the first line checks for.
 * Module and app are actually the same object. It's referred to as module inside the scope of the IIFE,
 * but app outside. Then, app becomes a shared object by all the js files. The different names help to
 * make the code a little more clear.

 * Note: better, more modern approach is to use JavaScript Class
